This repository demonstrates a common React Native error: 'Context value is undefined'.  The `contextBug.js` file shows the problematic code where a component attempts to access context without proper provision. The solution, shown in `contextBugSolution.js`, corrects the context access ensuring the consumer component is a child of the provider component. This repository aims to help developers quickly understand and resolve this frequently encountered issue.  The files are well-commented to aid in understanding the problem and its solution.
