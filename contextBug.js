This error occurs when you use a component that requires a specific context, but that context is not available in the component's render tree. This commonly happens when you try to access context in a component that is not a direct descendant of the context provider. For example, if you are using useContext hook to access a context value that is provided by a parent component, but the component where you are using useContext is not a direct child of the context provider, you will get this error.
